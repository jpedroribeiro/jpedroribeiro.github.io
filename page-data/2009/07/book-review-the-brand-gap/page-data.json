Throughout <a href=\"http://amzn.com/0321348109\">the book</a>, the author explains that a <strong>good brand</strong> is made by people or companies who master five branding disciplines: differentiation, collaboration, innovation, validation and cultivation. These five subjects and most topics of the book are illustrated by examples and historical facts, running along with diagrams and photos.</p>\n<p>While reading the book, you'll figure out that not only the content but the <strong>design of the book</strong> is also inspiring: from the book cover (a minimalistic yet effective design) to the one-sentence pages, the relevant graphic additions and the bold citations.</p>\n<h2>Just one small criticism</h2>\n<p>If I were to point a flaw on the book, I'd say is the amount of <strong>Americanized examples</strong>. Although I can't argue with the fact that most of the brands we know are American, it wouldn't hurt to throw a few non-American cases.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://amzn.com/0321348109\">The Brand Gap</a> is an amazing book. The almost 200 pages are <strong>easy to read</strong> and the subject is important to all people working on branding, from the junior designer to the CEO. The book, in fact, doesn't feel like a book, it's like an after class conversation between <strong>the student and the cool teacher</strong> who explains the way you understand and makes you want more about it.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Book Review: The Brand Gap","date":"July 04, 2009"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/2009/07/book-review-the-brand-gap/","previous":null,"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/2009/07/creating-your-own-portfolio-website/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Creating Your Own Portfolio Website - Single Page, Full Site or Blog style?","tags":null}}}},"staticQueryHashes":["63159454","792910177"],"slicesMap":{}}
