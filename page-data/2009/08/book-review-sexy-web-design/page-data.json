Have you ever thought that maybe there's a step missing or maybe a specific phase that needs more emphasis on? After doing some research on the subject I found out that <a href=\"http://elliotjaystocks.com/\">Elliot Jay Stocks</a>, a very cool designer from the UK, had recently written a book about this called <strong>Sexy Web Design</strong> published by <a href=\"http://www.sitepoint.com\">Sitepoint</a>, a cool Aussie based book publisher and web &#x26; design reference <strong>website</strong>.</p>\n<h2>Overall idea of the book</h2>\n<p>In this book, Elliot shows you his <strong>process</strong> of creating a sexy website, from the initial <strong>briefing</strong> with the client to the final updates on the <strong>mockup</strong>. The author explains the purpose of each phase, exemplifies showing successful websites online and applies the proper technique on a <strong>demo project</strong> that is covered throughout the book.</p>\n<p>Although the <a href=\"http://www.sitepoint.com/books/sexy1/\">book</a> covers a lot of content, the book doesn't go very deep on each of them and some topics are left with just a few lines of explanation. Elliot tries to fix this issue by giving external <strong>references</strong> but sadly they are mostly to Sitepoint links or their books, which sound a little biased. Don't get me wrong, I'm a frequent reader of <strong>Sitepoint</strong>'s website but it wouldn't hurt to throw a few more <strong>references</strong>.</p>\n<h2>The highlights</h2>\n<p>The chapter which covers <strong>inspiration and mood</strong> on websites is spot on just like the briefing and initial sketches approach suggested by the author. I like the idea of spending more time away from the computer to get your mind in the right place.</p>\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>I would really <strong>recommend</strong> this book to any web designer. Even if you are sure that your design process is good enough for your projects, there's always something interesting that lights a bulb in your head.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Book Review: Sexy Web Design","date":"August 15, 2009"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/2009/08/book-review-sexy-web-design/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/2009/08/random-illustrations-part-1/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Random Illustrations: Part 1","tags":null}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/2009/08/portfolio-iword/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Portfolio: iWord","tags":null}}}},"staticQueryHashes":["63159454","792910177"],"slicesMap":{}}
