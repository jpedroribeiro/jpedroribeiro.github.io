Developing websites to match all these <strong>browsers</strong> is no easy job. And don't even start talking about the different release versions. You can't force your <strong>visitor</strong> to use a specific software but your budget is limited and you can't create a whole new html for each one of them.</p>\n<p>Luckily the modern versions of these <strong>browsers</strong> are relatively compatible, one difference here, another there. Nothing that a separate stylesheet or a <a href=\"http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/reset/\">reset css</a> can't solve. One of them, however, take this to the extreme. Yes, I am talking about the evil <strong>IE6</strong>.</p>\n<h2>Losing Support?</h2>\n<p>IE6 is so full of bugs and <a href=\"http://css-tricks.com/ie-css-bugs-thatll-get-you-every-time/\">rendering problems</a> that several websites are not <strong>supporting</strong> it any more. <a href=\"http://www.digg.com\">Digg</a>, <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com\">Youtube</a>, <a href=\"http://www.orkut.com.br\">Orkut</a> and all <a href=\"http://www.37signals.com\">37 signals</a> products (Basecamp, Campfire...) just to name a few. <a href=\"http://jpedroribeiro.com/about-me/\">Personally</a> I don't design for IE6 unless the <a href=\"http://jpedroribeiro.com/portfolio/\">client</a> specifically asks for it.</p>\n<h2>To Do or Not To Do</h2>\n<p>It is a tough decision to make, even tougher without the proper <strong>information</strong>. A good start is to analyse the <strong>average visitor</strong> of your (or your clients) website. Check their <strong>OS</strong>, <strong>browser software</strong> and work from there.</p>\n<p>If a significant portion of the visitors have outdated browser then you might have no choice but to design for them. There are some information <a href=\"http://www.sitepoint.com/blogs/2009/03/06/10-fixes-for-ie6-problems/\">out there</a> that can help you with the most common issues.</p>\n<p>In case you have no <strong>traffic data</strong> you can check generic worldwide statistics. <a href=\"http://www.w3schools.com/browsers/browsers_stats.asp\">W3C</a>, <a href=\"http://gs.statcounter.com/\">StatCounter</a> and <a href=\"http://www.adtech.info/news/pr-04-01-2009_en.htm\">ADTECH</a> (Europe) are a few places that display this information <strong>online</strong>. Be aware that these statistics represent a very wide audience that maybe don't represent <strong>your</strong> audience. In this website for instance, less then 1% of my visitors use IE6. Mainly because this website`s targets are developers, designers and general web-savvy people.</p>\n<h2>Happy End?</h2>\n<p>According to <a href=\"http://www.w3schools.com/browsers/browsers_stats.asp\">W3Schools</a>, IE6 dropped 6% from January to September of this year. So lets be positive and one day we won't have to <a href=\"http://jpedroribeiro.com/2009/10/why-should-i-care-about-ie6/\">bother</a> about this particular browser. I mean, even <strong>Microsoft</strong> launched a <a href=\"http://arstechnica.com/microsoft/news/2009/09/microsoft-doubles-food-donations-for-ie6-to-ie8-upgrades.ars\">campaign</a> to promote <strong>browser</strong> upgrade.
