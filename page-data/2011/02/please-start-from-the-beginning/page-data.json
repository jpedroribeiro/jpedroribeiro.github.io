The weekly podcast interviews <a href=\"http://psftb.ryanhavoctaylor.com/interviews/\">amazing people</a> from the web design industry from all over the world.</p>\n<h2>Transcribing, Learning, Enjoying</h2>\n<p>The <a href=\"http://psftb.ryanhavoctaylor.com/design/naomi-atkinson/\">interview I transcribed</a> was with the lovely <a href=\"http://naomiatkinson.com/\">Naomi Atkinson</a>. She talked about her career, clients, being a freelancer and expectations for the future of the web industry.</p>\n<p>It was a fun experiment and a good experience to me to transcribe an interview in English, as I'm not a native speaker of the language. I had a great time doing it and hopefully, if my schedule allows it, I'll do it again.</p>\n<p>Check out this and other great interviews at <a href=\"http://psftb.ryanhavoctaylor.com/\">Please start from the beginning...</a>.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Please Start From The Beginning...","date":"February 20, 2011"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/2011/02/please-start-from-the-beginning/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/2011/01/photoshop-quick-guide-to-smart-object-smart-filters/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Photoshop: Quick Guide to Smart Object & Smart Filters","tags":null}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/2011/06/creating-expandable-banners-with-flash-and-javascript/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Creating Expandable Banners with Flash and Javascript","tags":null}}}},"staticQueryHashes":["63159454","792910177"],"slicesMap":{}}
