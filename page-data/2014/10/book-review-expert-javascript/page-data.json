JavaScript is a language that is very easy to get started but is actually more complex than it looks. That's the approach of Mark Daggett on the book <a href=\"http://markdaggett.com/blog/2013/11/28/introducing-expert-javascript/\">Expert JavaScript</a>.</p>\n<h2>A Conversation About JavaScript</h2>\n<p>What I really liked about this book is that it brings a very personal touch to a very technical book. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/heavysixer\">Mark</a> promptly states that it is a compilation of his favourite topics, like a collage of side notes. Similar style used by Crockford's <a href=\"http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9780596517748.do\">\"The Good Parts\"</a>.</p>\n<p>The topics range from objects to prototype, nodebots to unit testing. Each is very well written with just the right amount of complexity to cater for the more experienced coders.</p>\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p><strong>Expert JavaScript</strong> is a perfect choice of book for those moments when you need to see the language you use everyday from a different angle. Sometimes you'll revisit concepts you already know and sometimes you'll have to re-read the same chapter over and over to digest all the information available.</p>\n<p>The book is available at <a href=\"http://www.apress.com/9781430260974\">http://www.apress.com/9781430260974</a>.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Book Review: Expert JavaScript","date":"October 26, 2014"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/2014/10/book-review-expert-javascript/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/2012/12/book-review-the-mobile-book/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Book Review: The Mobile Book","tags":["book review"]}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/2015/07/being-technical-book-reviewer/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Being a Technical Book Reviewer","tags":["opinion","book review"]}}}},"staticQueryHashes":["63159454","792910177"],"slicesMap":{}}
