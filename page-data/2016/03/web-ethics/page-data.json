The one that stood out to most, possibly due to <a href=\"http://www.apple.com/customer-letter/\">recent events</a>, was privacy.</p>\n<p>And this is not restricted to the tech section anymore. It is now part of the main headlines.</p>\n<h2>Ethics in Development</h2>\n<p>I see privacy as a subset of security. When you build a website, your user base is expected to interact and leave <em>traces</em> of their private data around, be it in form of shared cookies or through a form submission.</p>\n<p>It doesn’t take long to see examples of <strong>bad practices</strong>. I’ve lost count of how many websites would send my password in plain text via e-mail. Or the e-commerce website who would expect me to type my payment details on their checkout without <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security\">SSL</a>. These companies are not being ethical with their customers and took the lazy route - putting security and privacy as a second class citizen.</p>\n<p>Your job as a developer is to make sure that the form goes through a secure connection and the data you stored in a cookie is properly encrypted. Not as a <em>nice</em> feature to have, but as a <strong>requirement</strong>.</p>\n<h2>Helping the users</h2>\n<p>Not all your users are going to be tech-savvy enough to know the dangers of leaving data around. Not even seasoned engineers can predict all the different scenarios so don’t expect others to do it.</p>\n<p>Being more <strong>empathetic</strong> about your client’s privacy is a step forward to ensure your website is behaving ethically towards them.</p>\n<h2>The Shift</h2>\n<p>This post is part of the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/startyourshift\">#startYourShift</a> initiative where everyone is invited to write about different topics each month.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Web Ethics","date":"March 20, 2016"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/2016/03/web-ethics/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/2016/02/thoughts-on-front-end-tooling/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Thoughts on Front-end Tooling","tags":["frontend","tools"]}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/2016/03/aggregating-google-analytics-browser-statistics-with-r2d2/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Aggregating Google Analytics Browser Statistics with r2d2","tags":["analytics","nodejs","tracking","browser"]}}}}}
