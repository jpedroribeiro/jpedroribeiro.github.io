When you rename a file, <a href=\"http://jpedroribeiro.com/tag/git/\">Git</a> believes the original file got deleted and suddenly there's a new file in which it knows nothing about. Hence the <em>untracked</em> status.</p>\n<h2>Alternative: rename with Git</h2>\n<p>If you want to avoid this behaviour, you could simply use the native <a href=\"http://jpedroribeiro.com/tag/git/\">Git</a> command: <em>git mv</em> `$ git mv README.md README-NEW.md $ git status On branch master Your branch is up-to-date with 'origin/master'.</p>\n<p>Changes to be committed: (use \"git reset HEAD ...\" to unstage)</p>\n<p>renamed: README.md -> README-NEW.md`</p>\n<p>Nice and easy.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"What's the deal with renaming files in Git?","date":"June 11, 2016"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/2016/06/whats-the-deal-with-renaming-files-in-git/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/2016/05/understanding-bandwidth-vs-latency-through-an-analogy/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Understanding Bandwidth vs Latency Through An Analogy","tags":["performance","latency","bandwidth"]}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/2016/08/book-review-using-webpagetest/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Book Review: Using WebPageTest","tags":["book review","performance"]}}}},"staticQueryHashes":["63159454","792910177"],"slicesMap":{}}
