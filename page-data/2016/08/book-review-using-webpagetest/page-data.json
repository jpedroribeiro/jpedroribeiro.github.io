It's by far the most complex and useful synthetic tool available these days. I've been using it for quite some time and decided to brush up my knowledge by <a href=\"http://jpedroribeiro.com/category/book-reviews/\">reading</a> <a href=\"http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920033592.do\">Using WebPageTest</a>, by O'Reily Media.</p>\n<h2>Back to basics</h2>\n<p>The book says clearly on the cover: \"...for novices and power users\" so you've been warned. I've been using WebPageTest, on and off, for years. If you are in the same situation, you might find that 70% of the book is too obvious or just common sense, after all, WebPageTest is a pretty self explanatory tool.</p>\n<h2>Hidden complexity</h2>\n<p>With that in mind, the advanced parts of the books are quite good. I was not fully aware of the <strong>script</strong> capabilities of WPT. The fact that you can give instructions to it and <strong>simulate</strong> a navigation flow is very powerful. You can simulate a login scenario by doing the following:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\"><pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">navigate http://www.example.com/login setValue id=u username setValue ud=p password submitForm id=login-form navigate http://www.example.com/profile/username</code></pre></div>\n<p>Other highlights include a full chapter on Continuous Integration, with plenty of examples on how to setup WPT and Jenkins or Travis, or how to setup a private instance of WPT - which I <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jpedroribeiro/status/766623046471942144\">struggled to achieve</a> a couple weeks ago!</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-lang=\"en\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Took me a day and a half but I finally managed to get WebPageTest working on AWS 😅</p>— João Pedro Ribeiro (@jpedroribeiro) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jpedroribeiro/status/766623046471942144\">August 19, 2016</a></blockquote>\n<script async src=\"//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script>\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>I <strong>definitely recommend</strong> reading this book. WPT is such a complex tool that I can guarantee you will find something new about it that you didn't know before.</p>\n<p>Having said that, bear in mind that <strong>WebPageTest</strong>, like any other <strong>open source project</strong>, is constantly being updated and you mind find some topics presented on the book are slightly outdated.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Book Review: Using WebPageTest","date":"August 29, 2016"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/2016/08/book-review-using-webpagetest/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/2016/06/whats-the-deal-with-renaming-files-in-git/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"What's the deal with renaming files in Git?","tags":["git"]}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/2016/12/progressive-web-apps/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Progressive Web Apps","tags":["pwa","offline","performance"]}}}},"staticQueryHashes":["63159454","792910177"],"slicesMap":{}}
