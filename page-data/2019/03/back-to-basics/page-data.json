So, as any web developer would do, I decided to rewrite the whole site instead.</p>\n<h2>Out with the old...</h2>\n<p>My previous hosting provider was stuck in the 2000's, and this is me being nice. It was very difficult (read: <em>impossible</em>) to upgrade <strong>backend applications</strong>, which led me to find hacky alternatives to achieve what I needed.</p>\n<p>The <em>Plesk</em> version was so old that there was no documentation or support available. If you've never used Plesk before... consider yourself lucky.</p>\n<p>It was a <strong>WordPress</strong> site. Which is a great tool, at least good enough for <a href=\"https://w3techs.com/technologies/overview/content_management/all\">33% of the internet</a>, but it wasn't fulfilling my needs. It is too big, bulky, high maintenance. I even had a <strong>crypto miner</strong> injected into my scripts for a while due to not updating some plugins [<em>insert facepalm emoji</em>].</p>\n<p>And I was also unable to migrate to HTTPS. Oh god, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VKcAYMb5uk4\">the horror</a>...</p>\n<h2>...and in with the new</h2>\n<p>So I ditched my old hosting company and setup a GitHub page. It's <strong>free</strong>, comes with <strong>SSL</strong> by default, integrates beautifully with static site generators, and enables you to use custom domains.</p>\n<p>Speaking of static site generators, doing this move led me to experiment with <a href=\"https://www.gatsbyjs.org/\">Gatsby</a>. I was already experienced enough with <a href=\"https://github.com/zeit/next.js/\">NextJS</a> but wanted to try something new - I'm a Frontend Engineer, I like shinny new things, OK?</p>\n<p>If you are not familiar with Gatsby, it lets you pull data from pretty much anywhere (Markdown files in my case), pipes it through <strong>GraphQL</strong> (which is awesome), and generates a compiled HTML ready to be used in any static hosting.</p>\n<p>This is made even easier when you fork from their own <a href=\"https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-blog\">gatsby-starter-blog</a> package. That's half of the work done for you.</p>\n<h2>But, and there's always a but</h2>\n<p>Static hosting means there's not much backend, server configuration allowed. Some links to my old site (<code class=\"language-text\">/tags/</code>, etc...) will 404 as I haven't created static pages for them (too lazy). This would be easy to solve with some 301 redirects but GitHub Pages has zero options to do that.</p>\n<p>Fair enough, it's not like this blog is a SEO heaven anyway.</p>\n<h2>Here is to a new beginning</h2>\n<p>The direction of this blog might change a bit. To prevent my inner procrastinator to only write 2-3 times a year I'll focus on more bite sized posts and add some <strong>personal</strong>, non-tech related topics as well.</p>\n<p>If you're curious about how this blog comes together, have a look at the source on <a href=\"https://github.com/jpedroribeiro/jpedroribeiro.com\">GitHub</a></p>\n<p>Feedback is welcome, reach me out on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jpedroribeiro\">@jpedroribeiro</a> and leave a comment.
