I was planning to attend the GraphQL Community Meetup, but my flight got slightly <strong>delayed</strong> and I ended up missing it. To be fair, it's entirely my fault as I was <em>way</em> too optimistic with the time it would take from landing at Schiphol Airport to getting all the way to the city centre, specially going through the immigration queues.</p>\n<h2>Day 2, part 1 - The Workshop</h2>\n<p>One of the things that attracted me to this conference was the chance of attending workshop with top class developers in different fields.</p>\n<p>The one I attended was the <strong>GraphQL Workshop</strong> with <a href=\"https://kitze.io/\">Kitze</a>, beautifully located at the <a href=\"https://www.google.com/maps/place/Royal+Industrieele+Groote+Club/@52.3724914,4.8933255,17z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x47c609c731728e8b:0xe01a4e4dd9accd2f!8m2!3d52.3724914!4d4.8933255\">Royal Industrieele Groote Club</a>.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BwGx6k7nTKs/\">https://www.instagram.com/p/BwGx6k7nTKs/</a></p>\n<p>Apart from a few issues with the lack of chargers and slightly cramped room, the workshop was excellent. Kitze managed to get a room filled with developers with different backgrounds and experience levels working with server side <a href=\"https://graphql.org/\">GraphQL</a> in no time.</p>\n<p>Personally, I'd rather spend more time on that area, but the agenda for the day was quite busy so we quickly moved to client side GraphQL, from barebones fetch to libraries like <a href=\"https://www.apollographql.com/\">Apollo</a>.</p>\n<h2>Day 2, part 2 - The Meetup (again, this time for real)</h2>\n<p>Just after the workshop, there was another meetup happening - The Official React Amsterdam Pre-party Meetup. Which I manage to attend this time.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BwH9THGnUCj/\">https://www.instagram.com/p/BwH9THGnUCj/</a></p>\n<p>This was a classic meetup format: free pizzas, networking and presentations. We heard from <a href=\"http://www.alessiodicrescenzo.com/\">Alessio Di Crescenzo</a> talking about his project React-Imago3d, and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jessicaleach6\">Jessica Leach</a> telling us all about ReactJS lifecycle methods.</p>\n<h2>Day 3 - The Conference</h2>\n<p>I was happily impressed by the quality of the speakers. This is the first conference that I attend where <strong>every</strong>, <strong>single</strong>, <strong>talk</strong> was great. I took so many notes I might need a day off to sort them out.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BwJaVGdlyNV/\">https://www.instagram.com/p/BwJaVGdlyNV/</a></p>\n<p>The highlights (and this was hard to pick) were <a href=\"https://twitter.com/siddharthkp\">Sid</a> walking us through how to refactor your ReactJS applications and get rid of <em>code smells</em>, followed by <a href=\"https://twitter.com/miuki_miu\">Elizabet Oliveira</a> who showed us the power of combining SVGs with React. She also <em>freestyled</em> mid presentation which was simply awesome.</p>\n<p>There was also a party with open bar, food, DJs, etc., and of course they had their own beer - React Blonde, brewed by <a href=\"https://www.deprael.nl/\">Brouwerij de Prael</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BwKYB1NlO8F/\">https://www.instagram.com/p/BwKYB1NlO8F/</a></p>\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>Every conference has its own issues and React Amsterdam wasn't an exception. Food was a bit of a problem, queuing was another, but honestly, these things don't take the shine away from the organizers who clearly put a lot of effort and managed to create a brilliant conference.</p>\n<p>I, for one, will be looking forward to next edition.</p>\n<h4>🎥 Live on YouTube</h4>\n<p>The event was broadcasted live on YouTube and the recording is available for anyone to watch on <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KfAS3zrvX8\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KfAS3zrvX8</a> .
