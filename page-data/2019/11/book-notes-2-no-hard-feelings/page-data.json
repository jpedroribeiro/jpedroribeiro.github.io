Another <strong>5-star</strong> rating on <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3186522-j-pedro-ribeiro\">my GoodReads</a>.</p>\n<p>Here are my <em>highlights</em>:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\"In modern business, collaboration is next to godliness\". But the downside to more collaboration is more conflict. <code class=\"language-text\">(p.11)</code></li>\n<li>Success depends on learning how to let emotion into the workplace without letting it run wild. By confronting our envy, we learn what drives us. <code class=\"language-text\">(p.11)</code></li>\n<li>You can also try a technique called <strong>reappraisal</strong> [...] reframing their stress as excitement. <code class=\"language-text\">(p.38)</code></li>\n<li><strong>Nothing diminishes anxiety faster than action.</strong> <code class=\"language-text\">(p.44)</code></li>\n<li>Ask your manager to define outcome rather than processes. <code class=\"language-text\">(p.56)</code></li>\n<li>Ordinary, incremental progress makes us happier and more engaged. <code class=\"language-text\">(p.56)</code></li>\n<li>Ask open-ended questions [...] \"How might we...\". <code class=\"language-text\">(p.56)</code></li>\n<li>The opportunity to <strong>level up</strong> is largely driven by you, by what you choose to absorb, by who you choose to learn from. <code class=\"language-text\">(p.62)</code></li>\n<li>(On asking for a raise) \"I don't want my salary to be a distraction to me while I am in this role\". <code class=\"language-text\">(p.98)</code></li>\n<li>Ask <strong>what</strong> not <strong>why</strong>: <strong>Why</strong> questions stir up negative emotions; <strong>what</strong> questions keep us curious. <code class=\"language-text\">(p.101)</code></li>\n<li>Don't rely on emotions (when making decisions). <code class=\"language-text\">(p.104)</code></li>\n<li>In a study of married couples, those who remain calm during arguments are the happiest and longest lasting. <code class=\"language-text\">(p.141)</code></li>\n<li><strong>Diversity</strong> is having a seat at the table, <strong>inclusion</strong> is having a voice, and <strong>belonging</strong> is having that voice be heard. <code class=\"language-text\">(p.185)</code></li>\n<li>Employees who do not switch from \"I\" to \"we\" during the first 6 months are more likely to leave. <code class=\"language-text\">(p.190)</code></li>\n<li>The best managers are <strong>shit umbrellas</strong>. When the shit hits the fan, they do what they can to protect their team form the emotional fallout. <code class=\"language-text\">(p.213)</code></li>\n</ol>\n<p>Liked this post?
