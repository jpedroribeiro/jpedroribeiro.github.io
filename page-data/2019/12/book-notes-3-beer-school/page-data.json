All wrapped in a writing that is informal and fun, like a chat with friends at your local pub. This is, yet, another <strong>5-star</strong> rating on <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3186522-j-pedro-ribeiro\">my GoodReads</a>.    </p>\n<p>Here are my <em>highlights</em>: </p>\n<ol>\n<li>Two-row (barley) is <strong>best</strong> because the proteins and starch are more evenly distributed, making it a more predictable grain to malt and brew with. <code class=\"language-text\">(p.25)</code></li>\n<li>Pilsner mal is bready, sweet and slightly honey. <code class=\"language-text\">(p.29)</code></li>\n<li>(Crystal malt) is commonly used in <strong>American IPAs</strong> to balance all the hop bitterness. <code class=\"language-text\">(p.30)</code></li>\n<li>Wheat is used to give beers more body and a subtle sweetness. <code class=\"language-text\">(p.34)</code></li>\n<li>Once water has been heated up in a brewery, it is no longer known as water. <strong>It becomes liquor</strong>. <code class=\"language-text\">(p.48)</code></li>\n<li>The hardness of the water refers to the concentration of calcium and magnesium. <code class=\"language-text\">(p.49)</code></li>\n<li>(On Citrah hops) is one of the <strong>most sought-after and expensive</strong> varieties in the world. <code class=\"language-text\">(p.61)</code></li>\n<li>The earlier you add a hop, the more bitterness it will impact. The opposite is true for aroma. <code class=\"language-text\">(p.68)</code></li>\n<li>(On bitterness) much like spice […] we slowly build resistance to it. <code class=\"language-text\">(p.75)</code></li>\n<li>(On yeast) it gives off three key biproducts: <strong>alcohol, carbon dioxide and esters</strong>. <code class=\"language-text\">(p.78)</code></li>\n<li>The colder something is the less your palate can break down the flavours, so <strong>drinking a beer slightly warmer</strong> will open it up and let the aromas and flavours really shine. By the same token, <strong>high carbonation</strong> can be a little distracting on the palate, so a less carbonated beer is easier to dissect. <code class=\"language-text\">(p.99)</code></li>\n<li>(On carbonated beer) if you’ve got a hoppy beer screaming tropical fruit, a <strong>keg</strong> is going to do it more justice. <code class=\"language-text\">(p.99)</code></li>\n<li>(On serving beer cold) Malt flavours seem bright, the alcohol sweetness is more balanced and the bitterness is less tannic. <code class=\"language-text\">(p.101)</code></li>\n<li>(On retro-nasa appreciation) Breathing out after drinking can bring all kind of aromas back in <strong>sharper focus</strong>, as well as create the fullest sense of a beer. <code class=\"language-text\">(p.136)</code></li>\n</ol>\n<p>Liked this post?
