The book is a comprehensive <strong>guide</strong> on creating web components with <strong>accessibility</strong> in mind.</p>\n<h2>The Book</h2>\n<p>The first thing you notice about the book is that it has the <a href=\"https://shop.smashingmagazine.com/\">Smashing Magazine</a> <em>quality standard</em>, both in terms of aesthetics and content.</p>\n<p>Throughout <strong>12 chapters</strong>, each dedicated to a specific type of component, the author explains in details how to create\nan accessible user interface from the most basic implementation to the most complete and advanced solution - not forgetting the steps in-between.</p>\n<p>It's in the chapter progression that the author excels in creating an engaging and <strong>educational</strong> writing. As the chapter evolves, so does the component in focus, with new building blocks being added to\nit. It's an approach that caters for a wide range of readers with different skill sets.</p>\n<p>JavaScript wise, it's unbiased towards frameworks (React and Vue are mentioned). In fact, most of the code samples are <em>framework-free</em>. Sometimes no JavaScript solutions are offered, as a display that the web is inclusive by nature.</p>\n<p>Visually, the book is simple and beautiful. Perfect binding, high quality paper, and a fabric <strong>bound bookmark</strong>. I cannot stress enough how much I like this book just for the fact that it has a bound bookmark. Tiny details count, people.</p>\n<h2>Some Highlights</h2>\n<p>A theme that is present throughout the book is the fact that you might have to write your code for different audiences. A user accessing your website with a screen reader and one using a mouse and cursor might need different elements to be present on the page.</p>\n<p>We can cater the screen readers audience by hiding aesthetic elements with <code class=\"language-text\">aria-hidden=\"true\"</code> or visually hide verbose elements for the mouse/touch crowd with a custom class like the one below:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\"><pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">.visually-hidden { \n    position: absolute !important;\n    height: 1px; \n    width: 1px;\n    overflow: hidden;\n    padding: 0;\n    border: 0;\n    clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\n} </code></pre></div>\n<p>This is a better approach than simply <code class=\"language-text\">display: none</code> as the latter would remove the element from the visual interface and screen reader output.</p>\n<p>Another interesting tip is to not allow non-interactive elements to have focus, which makes sense considering that an element that is focusable means it will also have some sort of feedback when interacted with</p>\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>As you can see by my bookmarks, this book has tons of useful tips. I've been doing web development for years now and after reading it I felt like I needed to refactor <em>all the things</em>.</p>\n<p>I'll end this review with a great quote from the book:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“Inclusive design mantra: If in doubt, spell it out.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>If you don't get it. <a href=\"http://book.inclusive-components.design\">Go get a copy of the book</a>, you won't regret it.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Book Review: Inclusive Components - Accessible web interfaces, piece by piece","date":"January 03, 2020"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/2020/01/book-review-inclusive-components/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/2020/01/quote-raji-lukkoor/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Quote #2","tags":["quotes"]}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/2020/01/meditation-apps-for-a-year/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"I used meditation apps for a year and here is what I found out","tags":["meditation","mindfulness","apps","anxiety"]}}}},"staticQueryHashes":["63159454","792910177"],"slicesMap":{}}
