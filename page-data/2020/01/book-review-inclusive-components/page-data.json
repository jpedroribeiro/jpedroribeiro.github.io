The book is a comprehensive guide on creating web components with <strong>accessibility</strong> in mind. </p>\n<h2>The Book</h2>\n<p>The first thing you notice about the book is that it has the <a href=\"https://shop.smashingmagazine.com/\">Smashing Magazine</a> quality standard. Aesthetically, the book is simple and beautiful. Perfect binding, high quality paper, and a fabric <strong>bound bookmark</strong>. I cannot stress enough how much I like this book just for the fact that it has a bound bookmark. Tiny details count, people.</p>\n<p>OK, now lets get back to the book’s contents.</p>\n<p>Throughout 12 chapters, each dedicated to a specific type of component, the author explains in details how to create an accessible user interface from the most basic implementation to the most complete and advanced solution. Not forgetting steps like progressive enhancements, JavaScript frameworks or even no-JavaScript solutions.</p>\n<h2>Some Highlights</h2>\n<p>A theme that is present throughout the book is the fact that you might have to write your code for different audiences. A user accessing your website with a screen reader and one using a mouse and cursor might need different elements to be present on the page.</p>\n<p>We can cater the screen readers audience by hiding aesthetic elements with <code class=\"language-text\">aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;</code> or visually hide verbose elements for the mouse/touch crowd with a custom class like the one below:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\"><pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">.visually-hidden { \n    position: absolute !important;\n    height: 1px; \n    width: 1px;\n    overflow: hidden;\n    padding: 0;\n    border: 0;\n    clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\n} </code></pre></div>\n<p>This is a better approach than simply <code class=\"language-text\">display: none</code> as the latter would remove the element from the visual interface and screen reader output.</p>\n<p>Another interesting tip is to not allow non-interactive elements to have focus, which makes sense considering that an element that is focusable means it will also have some sort of feedback when interacted with</p>\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>As you can see by my bookmarks, this book has tons of useful tips. I’ve been doing web development for years now and after reading it I felt like I needed to refactor <em>all the things</em>.</p>\n<p>I’ll end this review with a great quote from the book:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“Inclusive design mantra: If in doubt, spell it out.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>If you don’t get it. <a href=\"http://book.inclusive-components.design\">Go get a copy of the book</a>, you won’t regret it.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Book Review: Inclusive Components - Accessible web interfaces, piece by piece","date":"January 02, 2020"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/2020/01/book-review-inclusive-components/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/2020/01/quote-raji-lukkoor/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Quote #2","tags":["quotes"]}},"next":null}}}
