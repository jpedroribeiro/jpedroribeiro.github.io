After about 3 months, I've stuck to work days only - with an occasional session on weekends.</p>\n<h2>The Apps</h2>\n<p>After some consideration, I decided to go with <a href=\"https://www.aurahealth.io/\">Aura</a> &#x26; <a href=\"https://www.headspace.com/\">Headspace</a>. Mainly because I had an extended trial for both that would allow me to fully use their app without the <strong>free tier</strong> limitations.</p>\n<p><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 560px; \"\n    >\n      <a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/static/94f898cf09fccfd09817f79123c0d1de/b06ae/aura-headspce-apple-store.png\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n    <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 44.30379746835443%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/png;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        alt=\"Aura &amp; Headspace on Apple Store\"\n        title=\"\"\n        src=\"/static/94f898cf09fccfd09817f79123c0d1de/b06ae/aura-headspce-apple-store.png\"\n        srcset=\"/static/94f898cf09fccfd09817f79123c0d1de/c26ae/aura-headspce-apple-store.png 158w,\n/static/94f898cf09fccfd09817f79123c0d1de/6bdcf/aura-headspce-apple-store.png 315w,\n/static/94f898cf09fccfd09817f79123c0d1de/b06ae/aura-headspce-apple-store.png 560w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 560px) 100vw, 560px\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\"\n        loading=\"lazy\"\n        decoding=\"async\"\n      />\n  </a>\n    </span></p>\n<h2>The Good, the bad &#x26; the ugly</h2>\n<h3>Gamification</h3>\n<p><strong>Aura</strong> uses <em>day streak</em>, which makes no sense to me.\nIt only serves to pressure the user in using the app for the sake of it and induces <strong>anxiety</strong> rather than mitigates it.</p>\n<p><strong>Headspace</strong> takes it easy and only tracks <em>total minutes meditating</em>. It feels positive regardless of what that number means to you.</p>\n<h3>Day to day use</h3>\n<p><strong>Aura</strong> has loads of instructors. Each tackling different topics ranging from gratitude to life stories.</p>\n<p><strong>Headspace</strong> feels more like a continuous learning experience. The tracks (mostly) have an end goal. Like chapters on a book.</p>\n<p>I found that Aura was best for <strong>one-offs</strong> - that moment when you just need to sit down and get it going.</p>\n<h3>Quality Control</h3>\n<p><strong>Aura</strong>, due to its variety of instructors, has poorer quality standards compared to <strong>Headspace</strong>.</p>\n<p>I've notice the <strong>audio quality</strong> dropping to a very low level and there was also one session where the instructor literally <strong>coughed</strong> as they were giving the instructions - why wasn't that edited out is beyond me.\n<small>(Now, it's fair to notice that in total these might've been about 5-6 sessions throughout the whole year, so their quality <em>average</em> is still pretty good.)</small></p>\n<h3>Other notes</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>I've noticed there's a lack of proper <strong>offline</strong> support in Aura, even for tracks you <em>liked</em>. Headspace, if I'm not wrong, lets you re-listen to previous sessions.</li>\n<li>Headspace logged me off constantly. I think that happened on every app update.</li>\n<li>Aura had a nice feature of adding <strong>background white noises</strong> during a session. Great for relaxation.</li>\n<li>Both apps have some sort of <strong>community</strong> feel. Headspace has group meditation session which is quite interesting although I've only really done it a couple times.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>Taking the time to gather your thoughts and be mindful, even for a few minutes a day, does work. At least it did for me.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I've noticed the biggest change in the first 2-3 weeks.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n<p>After that, it became a habit. Part of my day to day routine. Not task that I <strong>had to</strong> do, but a moment I looked <strong>forward to</strong>.</p>\n<p>After <strong>1 year</strong> with these apps I am looking for something <strong>different</strong>. At the moment I'm giving <a href=\"https://wakingup.com/\">Waking Up</a> a try. I've listened to <strong>Sam Harris</strong> in a few podcasts and he seems to be someone who knows a thing or two about meditation. I'll report back in the future.</p>\n<h3>Which one should you pick?</h3>\n<p>I hate to say <em>it depends</em>, but it does.</p>\n<p>If you have never done mindfulness before and just want to have a taste of it, go for <strong>Aura</strong>. Have a couple sessions and see how you feel.</p>\n<p>If you want to <strong>learn</strong> and have a longer term guidance, pick <strong>Headspace</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>Maybe try both</strong>. Try other apps if you can.</p>\n<p>Either way, go for their free tier version first. And then, when you're ready to commit, subscribe. You'll get much more features on a <strong>paid</strong> tier.</p>\n<hr/>\n<h4><em>PS:</em></h4>\n<ul>\n<li><small>I've interchangeably used mindfulness and meditation throughout this article for brevity.
