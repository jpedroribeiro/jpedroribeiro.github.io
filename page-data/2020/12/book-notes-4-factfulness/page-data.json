A <strong>4-star</strong> rating on <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3186522-j-pedro-ribeiro\">my GoodReads</a>.    </p>\n<p>Here are my <em>highlights</em>: </p>\n<ol>\n<li>(On sword swallowing) “Young doctor, don’t you know that the throat is flat? You can only slide flat things down there. That is why we use a sword”. <code class=\"language-text\">(p.2)</code></li>\n<li>There is no gap (between rich and poor countries). Today, most people, 75%, live in the middle-income countries. <code class=\"language-text\">(p.28)</code></li>\n<li>We almost always get a <strong>more accurate picture</strong> by digging a little deeper and looking not just at the average but at <strong>the spread</strong>: not just the group all bundle together, but the individuals. Then we often see that apparently <strong>groups are in fact very much overlapping</strong>. <code class=\"language-text\">(p.42)</code></li>\n<li>More <strong>bad news</strong> is sometimes due to better surveillance of suffering, not a worsening world. <code class=\"language-text\">(p.74)</code></li>\n<li>People often glorify their early experiences, and nations often glorify their histories. <code class=\"language-text\">(p.74)</code></li>\n<li>Now that parents have reason to expect that all their children will survive, a major reason for having big families is gone. <code class=\"language-text\">(p.92)</code></li>\n<li>(On graph shapes) Don’t assume straight lines. Many trends do not follow straight lines […]. No child ever kept up the <strong>rate of growth</strong> it achieve in its first six months, and no parents would expect it to. <code class=\"language-text\">(p.100)</code></li>\n<li>Critical thinking is aways difficult, but it’s almost impossible when we are scared. <strong>There’s no room for facts when our minds are occupied by fear</strong>. <code class=\"language-text\">(p.103)</code></li>\n<li>The world seems scarier than it is because what you hear about it has been selected - by your own attention filter or by the media. <code class=\"language-text\">(p.123)</code></li>\n<li>“I had for some time been appalled by the systematic blaming of <strong>climate change</strong> on China and India based on <em>total</em> emissions per nation. It was like claiming that obesity was worse in China than US because the total bodyweight of the Chinese population was higher than of the US population. <code class=\"language-text\">(p.140)</code></li>\n<li>Whether measuring HIV, GDP, mobile phones sales, internet users, or CO2 emissions, a <strong>per capita</strong> measurement will almost always be more meaningful. <code class=\"language-text\">(p.141)</code></li>\n<li>“When I see a <strong>lonely number</strong> in a news report, it always triggers an alarm: What should this number be compared to? What was that number a year ago? Ten years ago? What is it in a comparable country or region? And what should it be divided by? What is the total of which this is a part? What would this be per person? I compare the rates, and only then do I decide whether it really is an important number”. <code class=\"language-text\">(p.142)</code></li>\n<li>Compare: big numbers always look big. <code class=\"language-text\">(p.143)</code></li>\n<li>When something goes wrong don’t look for an individual or a group to blame. Accept that <strong>bad things can happen</strong> without anyone intending them to. <code class=\"language-text\">(p.222)</code></li>\n<li><strong>Give the system some credit</strong>. When someone claim to have caused something good, ask whether the outcome might have happened anyway, even if that individual had done nothing. <code class=\"language-text\">(p.222)</code></li>\n</ol>\n<p>Liked this post?
