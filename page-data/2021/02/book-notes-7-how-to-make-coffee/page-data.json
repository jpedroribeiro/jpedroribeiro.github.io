A quick read that goes straight to the point.\n \n A **4-star** rating on [my GoodReads](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3186522-j-pedro-ribeiro).\n<p>Here are my <em>highlights</em>:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>(…) they are made up of a soft fleshy exterior with a shell that hosts the seed that we know as the coffee bean. <code class=\"language-text\">(pg.21)</code></li>\n<li>Your nervous system receptors are constantly monitoring your level of adenosine, and when they get too high, your brain will slow down your neural activity and dilate the blood vessels, making you feel sleepy or crave rest. Caffeine has a similar molecular structure to adenosine (…) meaning it can bind to your nervous system’s adenosine receptors without activating them.<code class=\"language-text\">(pg.33)</code></li>\n<li>Once consumed, caffeine is absorbed through the gastrointestinal tract and can remain in your system for between 6 and 8 hours. <code class=\"language-text\">(pg.34)</code></li>\n<li>Because it is both fat and water soluble, caffeine passes easily through the blood-brain barrier. <code class=\"language-text\">(pg.34)</code></li>\n<li>(on <strong>Pulsing</strong> method)… you take breaks at certain intervals to allow the water to drain… one break every 50/60 grams. <code class=\"language-text\">(pg.41)</code></li>\n<li>(on Blooming)… when you wet coffee grounds, they swell and bubble as the <strong>carbon dioxide</strong> is released. <code class=\"language-text\">(pg.42)</code></li>\n<li>(Stick to bleached paper)… as natural filters tend to give coffee a papery taste. <code class=\"language-text\">(pg.53)</code></li>\n<li><strong>Overextracted</strong> coffee - the kind that has spent too much time with hot water - tends to taste bitter. <code class=\"language-text\">(pg.61)</code></li>\n<li>When you use a <strong>blade grinder</strong>, some coffee beans get pulverized while others remain coarse. <code class=\"language-text\">(pg.86)</code></li>\n<li>Oxidation happens when oxygen molecules from either the air or the water in the coffee mingle with other molecules to create entirely different compounds that taste different from the original ones. Hence, <em>stale coffee</em>. <code class=\"language-text\">(pg.104)</code></li>\n<li>Almost all instant coffee is <em>robusta</em>. <code class=\"language-text\">(pg.108)</code></li>\n<li><strong>Brazil</strong> is the biggest coffee producer in the world. <code class=\"language-text\">(pg.131)</code></li>\n<li>All <em>green</em> coffee beans are kind of boring - they don’t smell or taste like much. <code class=\"language-text\">(pg.144)</code></li>\n<li>Some people like the <em>terroir</em> of the plant associated with wine. Other people like the aging/barreling <em>process</em> associated with whiskey. <code class=\"language-text\">(pg.148)</code></li>\n<li>Higher-quality beans are grown at higher elevations. <code class=\"language-text\">(pg.168)</code></li>\n<li>Cold coffee beans break apart in the grinder more consistently. <code class=\"language-text\">(pg.182)</code></li>\n<li>Coffee too acidic (sour), likely means your brew is underextracted. <code class=\"language-text\">(pq.252)</code></li>\n</ol>\n<p>Liked this post?
