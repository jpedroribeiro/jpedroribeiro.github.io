Caffeine has a similar molecular structure to <em>adenosine</em> (...) meaning it can bind to your nervous system's adenosine receptors without activating them.<code class=\"language-text\">(pg.33)</code></li>\n<li>Once consumed, caffeine is absorbed through the gastrointestinal tract and can remain in your system for between <strong>6 and 8</strong> hours. <code class=\"language-text\">(pg.34)</code></li>\n<li>Because it is both fat and water soluble, <strong>caffeine passes easily</strong> through the blood-brain barrier. <code class=\"language-text\">(pg.34)</code></li>\n<li>(on <strong>Decaffeinated</strong> methods) (...) beans are soaked for several hours in hot water, removing not only caffeine but also the oils and flavours. The beans are then separated from the water and the solvent is added to the water, again binding to the caffeine. The solvent is heated to evaporate together with caffeine. The water remaining is reused to process fresh batches of beans, but the beans and water now have the same balance of coffee oils and flavours. The process now removes only the caffeine from the beans(...).<code class=\"language-text\">(pg.48)</code></li>\n<li>If your coffee tastes a little <strong>sour</strong>; this is often due to <strong>underextraction</strong>. <code class=\"language-text\">(pg.69)</code></li>\n<li>(...) <strong>bitter</strong> coffee - this could be due to your beans, equipment, or brewing method, but it may also be caused by <strong>overextraction</strong>. <code class=\"language-text\">(pg.69)</code></li>\n<li><strong>Adjectives &#x26; intensifiers</strong> for coffee: Crisp, bright, vibrant, tart.
