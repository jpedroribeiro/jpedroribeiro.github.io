But melatonin has little influence on the generation of sleep itself. <code class=\"language-text\">(pg.22)</code></li>\n<li>For every day you are in a <strong>different time zone</strong> your suprachiasmatic nucleus can only readjust by about one hour. <code class=\"language-text\">(pg.24)</code></li>\n<li>The longer you are awake, the more <strong>adenosine</strong> will accumulate. <code class=\"language-text\">(pg.26)</code></li>\n<li>You can artificially mute sleep signal of adenosine by using a chemical that makes you fee more awake: <strong>caffeine</strong>. <code class=\"language-text\">(pg.26)</code></li>\n<li>Individuals who are deliberately <strong>fasting</strong> will sleep less as the brain is tricked into thinking that food has suddenly become scarce. <code class=\"language-text\">(pg.66)</code></li>\n<li>(...) migrating birds will grab brief periods of seep lasting only seconds in duration. <code class=\"language-text\">(pg.66)</code></li>\n<li>(...) <em>NREM</em> sleep helps transfer and make safe newly learned information into <strong>long-term</strong> storage sites on the brain. <code class=\"language-text\">(pg.74)</code></li>\n<li><em>REM</em> sleep can (help define what) a collection of information <strong>mean as a whole</strong>, not just as facts. We can awake the next morning with new solutions to previously intractable problems or even be infused with radically new and original ideas. <code class=\"language-text\">(pg.75)</code></li>\n<li>Sleep is not the absence of wakefulness. <code class=\"language-text\">(pg.108)</code></li>\n<li>(...) the more sleep spindles an individual has at night, the greater the restoration of overnight learning ability come the next day. <code class=\"language-text\">(pg.111)</code></li>\n<li>The second benefit of sleep for <strong>memory</strong> comes after learning (...), consolidation. <code class=\"language-text\">(pg.112)</code></li>\n<li>(...) <strong>emotional</strong> regions of the brain are up to 30% more active in REM sleep compared to when we are awake. <code class=\"language-text\">(pg.193)</code></li>\n<li>(...) <strong>REM sleep</strong> is the only time during the twenty-four hour period when your brain is completely devoid of this anxiety-triggering molecule (noradrenaline). <code class=\"language-text\">(pg.206)</code></li>\n<li>(...) REM sleep dreaming accomplishes 2 critical goals: remember (...) and forget. <code class=\"language-text\">(pg.206)</code></li>\n<li>(...) <strong>alcohool</strong> will often suppress REM sleep, specially during the first half of the night. <code class=\"language-text\">(pg.270)</code></li>\n<li>(On alarm clocks) The <strong>snooze</strong> feature means that you will repeatedly impose a cardiovascular spike again and again within a short span of time. <code class=\"language-text\">(pg.278)</code></li>\n</ol>\n<p>Liked this post?
