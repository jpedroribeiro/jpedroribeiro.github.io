Today, I’m going to talk about the the API’s other interface: <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/SpeechSynthesis\">Speech Synthesis</a>.</p>\n<h2>What is it about?</h2>\n<p>This interface enables synthetic voices to read plain text. The list of synthetic voices depends on which device you’re using and you can get a list of the available ones by running the <code class=\"language-text\">getVoices</code> method.</p>\n<p>A simple example of this API goes like this:</p>\n<p>const utter = new SpeechSynthesisUtterance(myTextField.value);\nutter.voice = window.speechSynthesis.getVoices()[0]]; // Picked the 1st available voice, which is also default\nwindow.speechSynthesis.speak(utter);</p>\n<p>You can also set other properties of your <code class=\"language-text\">SpeechSynthesisUtterance</code> instance, like pitch, volume, rate, volume <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/SpeechSynthesisUtterance\">and more</a>.</p>\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>On this <a href=\"https://github.com/jpedroribeiro/FunWithBrowserAPIs/tree/master/speechsynthesis\">GitHub repo</a> you can see the full implementation of the example above including a selector for all synthetic voices available on your device.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Fun with Browser APIs: Speech Synthesis","date":"May 09, 2018"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/2018/05/fun-with-browser-apis-speech-synthesis/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/2018/03/fun-with-browser-apis-speech-recognition/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Fun with Browser APIs: Speech Recognition"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/2019/03/back-to-basics/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Back to Basics"}}}}
