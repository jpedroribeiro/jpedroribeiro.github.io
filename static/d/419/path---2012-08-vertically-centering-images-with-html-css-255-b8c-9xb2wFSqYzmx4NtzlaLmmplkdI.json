That’s right.</p>\n<p>By setting the parent element’s display type to <code class=\"language-text\">table</code> and the child element to <code class=\"language-text\">table-cell</code> we can vertically align its content. Have a look at the code below:</p>\n<h2>HTML</h2>\n<p> <div>\n  <p>Centred element</p>\n </div></p>\n<h2>CSS</h2>\n<p>  div {display: table; height: 100px}\n  p {display: table-cell; vertical-align: middle;}</p>\n<p>Depending on your site structure, that parent tag could be <strong>non-semantic</strong> but it’s a price to pay! Also, you got to set a <strong>fixed height</strong> to this parent element.</p>\n<p>There are other solutions using <a href=\"http://jpedroribeiro.com/tag/jquery/\" title=\"Tag: jQuery\">jQuery</a> at page loading but to me it seems too much “power” for such a simple result.</p>\n<p>Got any other solution? <a href=\"http://jpedroribeiro.com/contact-me/\" title=\"Contact Me\">Let me know</a>!</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Vertically Centering Images with HTML & CSS","date":"August 03, 2012"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/2012/08/vertically-centering-images-with-html-css/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/2012/07/what-is-media-queries-and-how-to-use-them/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"What Is Media Queries And How To Use Them"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/2012/10/done-is-beautiful/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Done Is Beautiful"}}}}
