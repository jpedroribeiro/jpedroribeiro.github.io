The term is getting very popular especially due to Google’s effort and investment in the concept.</p>\n<h2>What is a Progressive Web App?</h2>\n<p>I kind of like <a href=\"https://twitter.com/lady_ada_king\">Ada Rose Edwards</a> definition: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ylZbXelPMA\">“A website so good you want to save it on your home screen”</a>.</p>\n<p>According to Google, a Progressive Web App is ”<em>a website or web application that is reliable, fast and engaging</em>”. Lets break down those 3 pillars:</p>\n<p><strong>Reliable</strong>: this is mostly about using <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/API/Service_Worker_API\">Service Workers</a> and enabling <strong>offline</strong> with the use of cache control and managing requests when connection is unstable.</p>\n<p><strong>Fast</strong>: we all know thats users leave websites if they take too long to load. Google is putting a lot of emphasis on <strong>performance</strong> these days and I wouldn’t be surprised if it becomes part of its indexing algorithm.</p>\n<p>Engaging: basically, the features that make a website look more like a <strong>native</strong> app - being installable, work on full screen, make use of <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/API/Push_API\">push notifications</a>.</p>\n<h2>Being Progressive</h2>\n<p>There is a focus on the <strong>new technologies</strong> like Service Workers and the Push API, but being progressive means catering for legacy browsers too. This is the basic idea of <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/technology/using-progressive-enhancement\">progressive enhancement</a> which we know and have been using for ages.</p>\n<h2>Where to start?</h2>\n<p>The Google Developer Team has been putting a lot of effort in this field, especially since their <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLNYkxOF6rcIAWWNR_Q6eLPhsyx6VvYjVb\">Summit</a> last September.</p>\n<p>They also have a very deep and beginner friendly portal with loads of articles and tutorials on the subject: <a href=\"https://developers.google.com/web/progressive-web-apps/\">https://developers.google.com/web/progressive-web-apps/</a></p>\n<p>Smashing Magazine, as always, has done the same and came up with a great article written by Kevin Farrugia on building PWAs: <a href=\"https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2016/08/a-beginners-guide-to-progressive-web-apps/\">https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2016/08/a-beginners-guide-to-progressive-web-apps/</a></p>\n<h2>My PWA on github</h2>\n<p>I’ve also being playing around with these concepts and build a very simple page to practise.
