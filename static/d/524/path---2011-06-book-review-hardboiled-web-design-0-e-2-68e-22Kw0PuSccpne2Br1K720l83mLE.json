It’s packed with HTML5 and CSS3 but with a different take. A <em>hard-ass</em> approach using the latest, emerging technologies.</p>\n<p>I’ve got to admit that I’m a big fan of <a href=\"http://stuffandnonsense.co.uk/\">Andy</a>’s work. <a href=\"http://www.transcendingcss.com/\">Transcending CSS</a> had a huge impact on <a href=\"http://jpedroribeiro.com/portfolio/\">my work</a> and the way I used to see markup and styling. And I had the same feeling after reading this book.</p>\n<h2>Hardboiled</h2>\n<p>As the book says: ”<em>‘Hardboiled’ web design is about never compromising on creating the best we can for the web. Hardboiled is about challenging assumptions.</em>”. This is just to give an idea of the tone used by the author throughout the book. Basically, the idea is to use all <strong>technologies</strong> available to us right now and not letting <a href=\"http://jpedroribeiro.com/2010/06/cross-browser-testing-resources/\">browser capabilities</a> drag us down.</p>\n<h2>The Book</h2>\n<p>Beautifully illustrated and designed, the book itself it’s different than everything you’ll ever see in the category. It’s one of a kind. It’s also a huge book with nearly <strong>400 pages</strong> divided into 4 big chapters.</p>\n<p>Each segment within these chapters is loaded with <strong>HTML5</strong> and <strong>CSS3</strong> techniques deeply explained (in a hardboiled way, of course) and exemplified using the book’s case study, plus, the author shows us real websites that are using it and gives us directions if we want further knowledge on the subject.</p>\n<p>The book is available at Five Simple Steps.
