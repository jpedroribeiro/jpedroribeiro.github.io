Featuring a comprehensive showcase of works in different media and across several decades.</p>\n<h2>The Book</h2>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/Making-Breaking-Grid-Layout-Workshop/dp/1592531253/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&#x26;s=books&#x26;qid=1260631305&#x26;sr=8-1\">The book</a> is basically divided into 2 parts. The first one about the <strong>creation</strong> of the grid-based designs and its usage. The second one explains the <strong>deconstruction</strong> of the grid, a different approach on design in which the grid doesn’t have to <strong>obey any rules</strong>. In the first few pages the reader will be immersed into the historical facts surrounding the development of the grid-based design. There is a lot of information here - about 150 years of <strong>art &#x26; design</strong> evolution in only 7 pages - maybe a timeline would be interesting. But then again, this is not a history book.</p>\n<p>The next chapter the <strong>author</strong> slows down the pace and starts a <em>workshop</em> about grid design. The content here is precise, clear enough for <strong>beginners</strong> and a good read for <strong>advanced</strong> designers. Concepts and styles are illustrated in a simple yet effective way and the examples are spot on.</p>\n<p>Then the showcase begins. Pages and pages of great <strong>artwork</strong> from different decades and styles. Each of them with its own grid style - column, modular grid, etc. Description and comments explain how it was used and the effect generated by it.</p>\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>As an introduction to grid-design, <em>Making and Breaking the Grid</em> does its job. It will give the initial hints and ideas of <strong>layout</strong> structure in a few pages but doesn’t go very deep. The highlight of the <a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/Making-Breaking-Grid-Layout-Workshop/dp/1592531253/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&#x26;s=books&#x26;qid=1260631305&#x26;sr=8-1\">book</a>, without any doubt, is the showcase of designs. Big illustrations and photographs with detailed information. Definitely a must-have on any <a href=\"http://jpedroribeiro.com/tag/books/\">designer library</a>.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://books.google.com/books?id=nslURExrg1sC&#x26;lpg=PP1&#x26;dq=making%20and%20breaking%20the%20grid&#x26;pg=PP1#v=onepage&#x26;q=&#x26;f=false\">Click here</a> for a preview on Google Books.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Book Review: Making and Breaking the Grid","date":"December 16, 2009"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/2009/12/book-review-making-and-breaking-the-grid/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/2009/11/portfolio-hooke-macdonald/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Portfolio: Hooke & MacDonald"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/2009/12/know-your-type-part-2-%e2%80%93-type-categories/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Know Your Type: Part 2 – Type Categories"}}}}
