It doesn’t mean you have to master them all, however you are expected to know what’s available. It’s a tough job.</p>\n<h2>Out with the old, in with the new (?)</h2>\n<p>We are surrounded by an ever increasing number of tools, libraries and frameworks. The <a href=\"https://www.ted.com/talks/barry_schwartz_on_the_paradox_of_choice?language=en\">paradox of choice</a> kicks in regularly in my day to day decisions.</p>\n<p>You could, of course, Google and see what everyone else is doing. Personally, I find it quite daunting. When picking, for example, a framework, people tend to become very dogmatic and the end result is nothing more than a shallow clickbait.</p>\n<p>New technologies arrive to serve a purpose. Understanding the problems they solve is more important than the tool itself since it will, eventually, change or evolve.</p>\n<h2>Questions yourself</h2>\n<p>When making a choice, try to answer yourself these questions: <strong>Why am I using X instead of Y?</strong> How much of this is a personal choice rather than professional? Am I following a trend?</p>\n<p><strong>What is X giving me that makes my job easier?</strong> Is the learning curve too steep for you and your team? How does it integrate with other systems? Can it be automated?</p>\n<p><strong>Do I know what X is doing behind the scenes or am I happy to treat it as a blackbox?</strong> Maybe the scope of the tool is too deep for my level or it crosses the border of the work I’m supposed to be doing.</p>\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>Asking myself those questions helps me clear my head and focus on my initial problem. This is especially true after browsing for a while and going through dozens of articles.</p>\n<p>In the end, more tools means more choices. See what applies to you, your team and, specially, your problem.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Thoughts on Front-end Tooling","date":"February 28, 2016"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/2016/02/thoughts-on-front-end-tooling/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/2016/02/compromise-balancing-project-needs-with-internal-ideals/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Compromise - Balancing Project Needs with Internal Ideals"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/2016/03/web-ethics/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Web Ethics"}}}}
