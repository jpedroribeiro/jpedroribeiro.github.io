I’m going to try to explain the differences between <strong>bandwidth</strong> and <strong>latency</strong> by using an analogy*. Bear with me.</p>\n<h2>Road to performance</h2>\n<p>Picture <strong>bandwidth</strong> as being the amount of luggage you can fit inside the boot of a car.</p>\n<p>Now imagine <strong>latency</strong> as being the distance between you and your destination, let’s say Brighton.</p>\n<p>You can fit (<em>bandwidth</em>) as much as you want as long as it fits the boot of your car. And for this exercise, let’s ignore the differences between cars.</p>\n<h2>Time for upgrade</h2>\n<p>You feel it’s time to <strong>upgrade</strong> your vehicle as you have too many things to carry. You upgrade it to a 5mb/s connection, I mean, a <strong>big truck</strong> with lots of space to fill (bandwidth).</p>\n<p>Everything is great and you can carry all the items you want. But you still need to go to Brighton, and it’s quite far away (<em>latency</em>).</p>\n<p>The distance (<em>latency</em>) is still the same, no matter how much you can carry (<strong>bandwidth</strong>) in one go.</p>\n<h2>Summing up</h2>\n<p>This is why <em>streaming</em> movies requires good bandwidth, as you need to carry a lot of data in one go. Websites, on the other hand, perform better when latency is reduced, lots of small files requires lots of roundtrips.</p>\n<p>* This is not an original idea. I’ve read similar analogies several times. This is <strong>my take</strong> on it.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Understanding Bandwidth vs Latency Through An Analogy","date":"May 14, 2016"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/2016/05/understanding-bandwidth-vs-latency-through-an-analogy/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/2016/05/__trashed-4/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"request anim frame"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/2016/06/whats-the-deal-with-renaming-files-in-git/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"What's the deal with renaming files in Git?"}}}}
